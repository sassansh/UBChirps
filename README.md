People at UBC often find themselves split across the internet.
Platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit can feel impersonal or inaccessible.
UBChirps gives us a dedicated platform to connect about all things UBC.

Members of UBChirps can view each other's thoughts and express their own.
We hope to foster a greater sense of community among those of us at UBC, and we hope that
Our users will contribute to a safe and inclusive online community.
