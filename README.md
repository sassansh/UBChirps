# UBChirps

## A full-stack social media app directed towards the UBC community.

People at UBC often find themselves split across the internet.
Platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit can feel impersonal or inaccessible.
UBChirps gives us a dedicated platform to connect about all things UBC.

Members of UBChirps can view each other's thoughts and express their own.
We hope to foster a greater sense of community among those of us at UBC, and we hope that
Our users will contribute to a safe and inclusive online community.
